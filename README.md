## Description

We have created an app that asks users to create an account and sign in. Once the user has signed in they are prompted with a onboarding screen that takes a users information and then once they submit the answers they are presented with questions to hopefully match them with another user. Once matched the user will be brought to a chat room to talk to the matched users. We wanted to create this app to match college students who are attending a College to be able to find other College students who they could potentially be friends with and create a better college atmosphere.
